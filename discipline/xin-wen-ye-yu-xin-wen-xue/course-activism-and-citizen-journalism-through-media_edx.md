# Course: Activism and Citizen Journalism through Media\_edX

How to identify a newsworthy story and target audience  
Well you want to try and describe them,create a profile of them; Are they young?Are they old?What language do they speak? Do you knowWhere they are? Do you know anythingabout their other interests? What do youknow about their media habits? The reasonthis is so important is you can't reacheverybody, even Kim Kardashian didn'tbreak the internet with everybody. So ifyou, the more specific you can be thebetter because you can, A it's cheaper soyou can actually the more you can focusdown on a particular target audience themore likely you are to be able to reachthem effectively and cost-effectively,but also you can tailor your message andyour content to that audience, we're notall the same. We don't speak the samelanguages, we don't have the sameattitudes to life, we're not at the samelife stage, so if you understand moreabout them because you've really got aclear picture of them in your mind, youcan craft your content to suit them, torelate to them and to have an effect onthem.So that's interesting, there's many waysto go about round exploring the audience,one place to start is who does it matter that your message gets through to? So forexample we were working in the SouthAfrican governments HIV and AIDScommunications campaign, which is calledthe Khomanani campaign and we wentand asked the doctors and theepidemiologists, who understood how thedisease was spreading and who could tellus which people were most vulnerable,most likely to either transmit or haveHIV transmitted to them and it turnedout one of the most vulnerable groupswas young women, post puberty, teenageyoung women but also women in their 20sthat they had turned out were mostlikely to contract HIV. So we could thenaddress those women in particular withmessages and content that related totheir lives, but we knew that if we reachthose women effectively, if they heardour message and if they acted on it thenwe'd have the most significant impact onthe issue we were trying to addresswhich was reduce HIV transmission.  
There are different places to look forinformation and really there's twodifferent approaches; so first off youcan try and find data especially aroundthe media platforms or channels thatyou're planning to use, so if you'replanning to use a newspaper you can goand find out information on who thatnewspaper reaches as they reach oldpeople or younger people does it reachprofessionals or does it reach youngstudents or school people? If you'reworking with radio, how broad is theirsignal? What's the geography of theiraudience? What language is it in? and allof this information can help youunderstand the audience you're going toreach, that kind of data is availableoften from the media themselves, it'ssometimes available from researchorganisations that collate that data andit's also sometimes available fromregulators, but the other approach is ifyou've got this really good descriptionof your audiences go and find somepeople like that, go and find the peopleyou believe are the people you're tryingto reach and talk to them, discover whatthey're interested in, discover what theyfeel or think about the issue you'readdressing and learn as much about themas you can and then as you develop yourcontent and your media then go and testit with them. The more you test the morefeedback you get from them. Then the morelikely you're going to be effective andimpactful in your communications withthem, often people in media tend to usethemselves as a proxy for that audiencethey're trying to reach, but we're alldifferent and you may not be like thepeople you're trying to reach, you maynot have the same values, you may nothave the same attitudes or interests, sothe more you spend time with yourintended audience the more likely it isyou'll produce better media that's goingto be effective in communicating withthem.  
  


### Pitching a story

  
We are going to look at how the functional tools of social media can be beneficial foryou, when the story gathering and story writinghas been done. Critical to that, we've got a number of newsvalues, even before you can think of gathering news. We've got a number of newsvalues that you need to consider. But for the purpose of this presentation wewill only look at four.   
Which the first one will be you have to understandyour audience, first and foremost, you have to understandwhat, how your audience is, the demographics of your audience.  
Secondly, you need to understand that the type of story that you are pitching, itsproximity, how close the story is to the communitiesor to your audience. We talk about audience but we are talkingcitizen journalism here. Sometimes we may interchangeably so usethe word community and use the word audience. But we'll use that those with interchangeablyas we continue. So proximity, how close is the story to thecommunity that you are relaying the story to?You need to look at the impact. The issue or the story that you are deliberating or thestory that you are writing, what is its impact on the communities? How is it affectingthe communities? What change does it bring on the communities?You need to look at the timeliness part of it. The timeliness part of it isthe topicality of it. Why do you have to tell the story, thatparticular story now? Why is it important that you talk about that story now?And you need to look at the conflict part. Is the story having differentversions? You need to understand that if I am pitching up the story whatis the other versions of the story of different sides until you come to yourown version of the story then you can relay the story.  
That's true, I think when you talk stories we also have different types of stories. Studentsof journalism will tell you that you'vegot what we call hard news and you've got what we call soft news. So when you pitcha story that different types of news. You need to look at the nature of thecontent that you're going to write about or that you're going to speak about in the writingprocess. So understanding the difference between thetwo, soft news and hard news, helps you determine the angle. You know you talkabout different versions the angle in which you're going to take and thechoice of words that you are going to use. Which we are talking aboutfeature there, I think it's a feature, the soft one they'll call it feature.Sometimes you can write a feature which is more like relaying or relating your ownpersonal story. Sometimes they say a feature will be a little bit like asubjective but while you look at the hard story you will have to be moreobjective. There are people who can tell their own stories from their personalexperiences. Now that that is when they'll be taking the approach of the feature.True, when you move to hard news it's very important for you tounderstand that people that are on social media, for example, they don'twant to stay for too long on the medium. So you don't want to bombard them withcontent that will be difficult for them to comprehend. So every time when youwrite a story, a hard a news story on social media it's important for you tobe cognisant of the length because people don't want to stay there for too long.Another important element critical to storytelling is the imagesand video that you use, they tell a story. When you google Marikana for example somethingthat happened recently, the Marikana Massacre, and then look at the type of pictures,the type of images and videos that were used when telling differenttype of stories. I mean there is one example of a young child holdinga gun and holding a spear from the area where the miners used to live, fromthe shacks, those areas. Just looking at that picture you, that childcannot be older than ten years when you look at the picture. And, ifthat child is able to carry a gun and carry a spear that picturealone tells a lot, a mood and the atmosphere exactly, how volatile the situationwas at that point in time.

Pitching – best practicesPitching is a difficult and yet crucial part of getting your messages into the media.Here is a brief list of best practices for you to take forward.

* In the beginning, it is good to show right away that you are familiar with the correct person to contact, the different sections of their publication and how your story may fit in where. You need to initially show them that you are not spamming them, but that you have taken the time to research why your story may be complementary to their publication.
* After you have made the initial introduction you want to set up the story as quickly as possible. You want to explain to people the context and why it is important in a broad way.
* After you have set up the story, you would then want to move into your “newsy hook”. This is what makes your story timely. This is why the media entity should be running the story as soon as possible. It also should also give details, such as the number of people involved. It also puts a person into your story, for example, a character like Bricks Mokolo, that your readers can relate to.
* This is the time to give your story some colour and perhaps reveal a few of the more shocking elements. You don’t want to make this section too long.
* This is where you should bring in the “angle” for your story. This is how you can make your story relevant to your readers. You need to find the MOST pertinent connection between what you are saying and proposed readers, this means the part of the story that influences their lives the most. For example, if the story is about people protesting the price of graves, then the angle you choose could be around the mayor because he is someone that should be held accountable for what has happened. Another example of an angle would be to look more deeply at the physical space in the area, how that is owned and divided up. You also, at this stage, need to outline exactly who you are going to speak to and why.
* Finally, take the opportunity to sell yourself and explain why you are best placed to write this story. And be sure to include a link to your portfolio or at the very least a social media account.

## What Makes a Story Newsworthy?

News can be defined as "Newsworthy information about recent events or happenings, especially as reported by news media". But what makes news newsworthy?There is a list of five factors, detailed below, which are considered when deciding if a story is newsworthy. When an editor needs to decide whether to run with a particular story, s/he will ask how well the story meets each of these criteria. Normally, a story should perform well in at least two areas.Naturally, competition plays a part. If there are a lot of newsworthy stories on a particular day then some stories will be dropped. Although some stories can be delayed until a new slot becomes available, time-sensitive news will often be dropped permanently.

#### 1. Timing

The word news means exactly that - things which are new. Topics which are current are good news. Consumers are used to receiving the latest updates, and there is so much news about that old news is quickly discarded.A story with only average interest needs to be told quickly if it is to be told at all. If it happened today, it's news. If the same thing happened last week, it's no longer interesting.

#### 2. Significance

The number of people affected by the story is important. A plane crash in which hundreds of people died is more significant than a crash killing a dozen.

#### 3. Proximity

Stories which happen near to us have more significance. The closer the story to home, the more newsworthy it is. For someone living in France, a major plane crash in the USA has a similar news value to a small plane crash near Paris.Note that proximity doesn't have to mean geographical distance. Stories from countries with which we have a particular bond or similarity have the same effect. For example, Australians would be expected to relate more to a story from a distant Western nation than a story from a much closer Asian country.

#### 4. Prominence

Famous people get more coverage just because they are famous. If you break your arm it won't make the news, but if the Queen of England breaks her arm it's big news.

#### 5. Human Interest

Human interest stories are a bit of a special case. They often disregard the main rules of newsworthiness; for example, they don't date as quickly, they need not affect a large number of people, and it may not matter where in the world the story takes place.Human interest stories appeal to emotion. They aim to evoke responses such as amusement or sadness. Television news programs often place a humorous or quirky story at the end of the show to finish on a feel-good note. Newspapers often have a dedicated area for offbeat or interesting items.

#### Newsprint: How to write an article

  
Digitally you can write an article onyour phone and distribute it on WhatsApp.You need the leastamount of resources in order tocommunicate and your audience needs verylittle to receive it. However, if you aregoing to take the path of producingphysical print media it can getexpensive. You can print your materialyourself in the form of a pamphlet or anewspaper. This allows you to havecomplete control but it takes more moneyand work. Or you can pitch your articleto a local newspaper. For this you willneed a news hook. This means something important needs to have happened veryrecently for a newspaper to be interested.They want to publish onissues that happened yesterday if possible.So if you have been working onan issue for a long time and then animportant incident happens that youthink highlights your issue and would berelevant and recent for a local newspaper,then let them know.Newspapers have very low budgets. So you may have tobe willing to give your work for free or for very little money.  
You need to think about language andliteracy, and these are the two factorsthat can limit the reach of your articles.If a person who receives yourarticles can't speak the language inwhich it was written then it's no good,and if they can't read in any languagethen it would have been better tocommunicate with radio or television,which we're going to get into later.So you need to think about directing yourwritten messaging exclusively to thepeople who can read and understand you.The skills you need are high but ifyou're passionate and know your subjectthen you can succeed. Let's get a littleinto how to write.   
You start by writingthe five most important points that youwant to communicate on a piece of paper.They can be in any order but only five.This should be quick right off the top of your head.Now you take the mostrelatable point on your piece of paperthe one that can be linked to a personor a story and you start with that.Use this point to start your article in anemotional and dramatic way. This is howyou engage your readers from the very beginning.They want a scene that isexciting and use all your senses when you write.Don't just describe the visualbut also if there were smells, sounds oreven tastes as these will lodge in yourreaders minds and force them to read on.And be sure to introduce your reader toa central character that they can relate to.This is someone that isn't youbut it's someone who is very importantto the issue that you're trying to address.Then go back to your list offive points and choose the one that willgive your reader context.This is why your issue is important. For example thewater crisis is affecting six millionpeople in your country or poor votereducation is influencing 200 municipalities.So now you've gone from aspecific emotive example in your firstparagraph to explaining why this is partof a much larger problem. Now go back toyour piece of paper and put the remaining three points in an order of importance.Write the most important of these three as your third paragraph andthis is crucial you need to link thispoint to the story that you started within your opening paragraph and to yourcentral character. Because people arereading your article for the story notfor the information. You're going togive them information about your issuewithout them even realising it,because they're going to be invested in your story.When you have fleshed out theremaining three points into three paragraphs,then you need to write a conclusion.This is an important partbecause you want to finish the storythat you're telling, but also make surethat you communicate that the is not solved.This is where you write inyour call-to-action, what needs to bedone by your readers to make adifference and most importantly how theycan do this then.   
Finally, you write a headline.This is easier to do lastbecause now you understand the storyonce it's completed and make sure thatyour headline is intriguing but alsodoesn't give too much information away.You want people to read beyond theheadline so keep it short and teasing.If you're writing for online then youraudience receives it instantly. If you'rewriting for a newspaper then, there maybe some delay as this could be daily oreven weekly in publication. Be sure toinclude your contact details with thearticle so people can find you directlyand you can continue the conversation online.  
  
  


  
How to script for Radio  
  
Radio is a powerfulpenetrative medium. It is also the medium bestsuited for us to tell stories.If you think about how you seeyourself and your own life it is in theform of a story. It is the way humans seethe world and if that is how you frameyour activism then it can becomeengaging for the people you are trying to reach.  
You have a choice here, either youproduce your own podcast and distributeit online or you partner with a localradio station and appear on a set showlive behind the mic. Podcasting is agrowing way for people to distribute audio digitally.You have completefreedom to say whatever you want butyou'll have to get a microphone torecord and an account with a platformlike SoundCloud onto which to upload it.However, there is a chance with a podcastthat after you upload it no one finds iton the internet and no one hears you.People need data or access to Wi-Fi inorder to download your podcast and listen.If you appear on an establishedradio show you will need to have contactwith the people that work there andconform to their times, shows and work with their presenters.If you partner with a local station thenyou will directly broadcast to thepeople around you, in the vicinity of theradio station. With a podcast you canreach potentially anyone in the worldwith an internet connection. However, thismay mean that you miss the people rightin front of you that you want to connect with.Be aware that your issue is part ofa local story and a national story.If you are appearing on a local communitystation then it's important that youcome to them with a powerful local story.And if you can bring a person to sit inthe studio with you who has beendirectly affected by the issue that you are championing.These local people and storiesare one that mainstream media will notbe able to get because they don't haveaccess to the people and informationthat you can connect with.However, your listeners also engage with larger national stories.They also read national websitesand read big newspapers. So youcan develop a more powerful campaign ifyou're able to link your issue to anational and a local story.Be sure to prepare your facts andinformation very well before you getbehind that microphone. People who havebeen on radio for many years sound likethey're just having a casualconversation with a close friend.It takes a lot of practice and preparationto sound like that. Imagine when you arespeaking into that microphone thatyou're talking to one person, and be sureto speak in stories. Tell them about aperson who is deeply affected by theissue you are trying to address.People connect with the stories of other peoplenot facts or numbers. However, you needyour facts prepared and be sure to speak visually.Describe in detail the hardshipthat people are facing. Get the listenersto feel emotion so they can be with youon your journey , and don't assume thatyour listeners know who you are or whatyour cause is. A big mistakeactivists make when they appear on radiois they forget that people may not beaware of them or their cause at all.So imagine you're speaking to a person whohas just arrived from a foreign land andyou need to give them all theinformation they need in order to agree with you.Another thing to remember isexpress emotion. Laugh, be excited or sadas the story demands it but don't getflustered or speak too quickly.It is okay to pause and take a breath.When you talk into the mic be sure that yourmouth is always the same distance away,usually a couple of inches.If you address someone else in the studio don'ttalk off mic as then the listeners won'thear you and they are the most importantpeople who you're trying to reach.If you are editing audio, so if you'verecorded yourself speaking and are nowediting it on the computer, you may betempted to make a lot of edits, so youknow, you sound more professional.The important part is you want to edit outmistakes but you don't want to edit outwhat makes you sound human. So you cankeep the occasional uum and uuh as that makesyou a person that your audience can relate to.  
  


  
How to use social media to forward your campaigns  
  
Hello everybody, my name is Tshepo Tshabalala and I will be sharing a few guidelines onhow to use social media to forward campaigns. We will specifically focus on Twitter.So what is Twitter? Twitter is a social networking platform usedto share and disseminate information by users who have signed up to the platform.Twitter also allows users to send private messages to an individual or a group of people.So how does it all work? Users post and publish short messages, orwhat is commonly known as tweets from their account. The tweets are limited to 240 characters.If your account is public, other users called “followers” can see your tweets. But ifyour account is private, only those people who follow you can see your tweets.So within that tweet you can also include a hashtag. A Hashtags is a word or phrase preceded bya hash sign \(\#\), used on social media websites and applications, especially Twitter, to identifymessages on a specific topic. For example during 2015/2016 many studentsembarked on the \#FeesMustFall protests across various universities in South Africa.On social media platforms and especially on Twitter, users published twitter posts usingthe hashtag \#FeesMustFall as well as hashtag \#FMF.It is important to do your research on the hashtag you want to use for your campaign.Try to create a hashtag that has not been used before and also KISS.Try to keep it short and simple, it is also best to if the hashtag is an understandableword, phrase or abbreviation. By keeping it short, other users will be able to rememberit and use it. It is important to also limit the number ofhashtags you use in your tweets. During the Fees Must Fall protests, users used two hashtags.\#FeesMustFall and \#FMF.  
With all that in mind, now we need to create the tweet or campaign. When you start a campaign,a lot of work goes into it. You have to carefully plan it, launch it,execute and measure it. When planning a campaign, think of ways it can get traditional mediacoverage as well as attention on social media.   
It is important to humanise your voice onTwitter for your followers to really engage in your tweets.Write tweets that are easily understandable and can gain traction on twitter very quickly.Remember to also use hashtags so that your message can be found by anybody on twitterwho searches for this hashtag. When writing your messages, try to keep itshort and simple, to get your message across very quickly.You can write a message that has a bit of humour or ask a question or create a survey.What you can also do is create a thread of tweets where you can post several tweets from.With a thread you can provide additional context, an update, or an extended point by connectingmultiple Tweets together. Someone who clicks on the hashtag could comeacross one of your tweets and follow your thought process in a long thread of tweets.So remember, whatever your campaign goal is if your target audience has access to theinternet, there is an opportunity to build a successful campaign.  
So what content should be in your tweets?Your social media posts should be varied and should not only be just text.Use graphics and links and photos in addition to the text. Try not to repeat in your text what isalready in your or image. You have all of that now the campaign has to go live.Once you’ve created a strategy of how youwill execute your plan, you need to now start the campaign.  
Remember that these guidelines I am sharing can and should be used on other social mediaplatforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.When you go live, remember to use these different platforms to target and access different typesof audiences. So plan out your social media strategy carefully.Your campaign should not be limited to just social media. You can use social media torecruit people for a peaceful protest on a specific day.Through your tweets you will inspire people to action.So how do we use the different social media platforms to galvanise people for a course?So on Facebook you can create an event to saythere will be a protest taking place on such a day in the city.That will get a lot of people to “sign up” to your event and you would be able to trackwhether people are interested or not. On Instagram you could create “instagramstories” to share more information about the protest or share links of where peoplecan get more information about the protest. You can also do a question and answer withfollowers on Instagram. So during the campaign you should also engagewith your audience and followers. Retweet other users content that is related to yourcause, share their images and graphics as well. Remember retweet or repost images or videos thatother users may send to you. You can also ask your followers to share andretweet your posts. If your campaign has a protest as part of it, you could also go “live”on video to give other users who may not be at the protest a sense of what is going onon the ground. You could use an app called “periscope”for Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram have live features which you could make useof.  
  


  
Activism through mobile platforms  
Now that you have heard from my colleagues, you can understand that Citizen journalismis also known as participatory and democratic journalism. At present varioususer-generated websites, including news portals and blog sites, are operating across the globe that offercommon masses a platform to be citizen journalists and share their stories with rest of the world.It should not be wrongly deduced, that citizen journalism has only come into existence asa result of the recent advancements in technology.Chris Daly, a professor of journalism at the Boston University, explains in a documentaryby Cambridge Community Television \(a US based electronic media public training forum\), thatone of the first forms of citizen journalism arrived in the 1760‘s in the form of pamphlet.The pamphlet was a guerrilla style journalism, giving an example of Tom Paine who was arevolutionary activist known for his perceptive commentaries.He wrote the popular pamphlet "Common Sense" that appealed to encourage common peoplein the Colonies to fight for egalitarian government. According to Rabia Noor in her paper titled"Citizen Journalism vs. Mainstream Journalism: A Study on Challenges Posed by Amateurs", Citizenjournalism appears to have caught the hold of print media steadily in Kashmir.One of the leading daily English newspapers of the valley, Greater Kashmir, in 2011 tookthe initiative of encouraging citizen journalism in Kashmir.Since then the publication has been inviting write ups and photographs from its readerspertaining to various issues concerning them.The newspaper publishes the citizens’ content on it's daily city page under "We the Srinagarites"and "Colony Woes" columns. In January 2014, the publication came up with yet another citizenjournalism segment, "Is Anybody Listening?" Radio has been interactive for a long timebecause of it's telephone features. Radio used mobile phones for call backs and we’ve had callersas “reporters” in a sense for quite some time. Community stations radio stations havecovered political activism, labor and homelessness for decades which later saw to activists incorporatingradio broadcasts, podcasts and live audio feeds into participatory multimedia projects.Radio stations help to realise the promise of a hyperlinked media, but they remain crucialin their own right. While news is widely available on the socialmedia networks, the role of the journalist to be fair, accurate and thorough is heightenedby the volume of possible and potentially non-credible news sources.  
There are fundamental principles that apply in all mediums.News is never about what’s important. It is always about what is interesting.If you want to pitch a story about your cause to the news media, you need a “news peg”.A news peg is what makes the story timely or newsworthy now.It is also referred to in newsrooms as the “hook” because the angle is used to grab,or hook, the reader’s attention to make them want to read or listen to the rest ofthe story. In sorting through a mass of material, CarmanCumming and Catherine McKerracher of Carleton University tell reporters to think about “S-I-N”— which stands for Significant, Interesting and New.For example, you could be working for months on a story about, say, increased costs ofhealthcare in your area, but your news peg might just announce hike in health insurancecosts. It would be the element of the story thatmakes it timely and important now, the reason why you wouldn’t wait two weeks for you to run thestory.Two of the most common news pegs are an event in the news that relates to your cause oran activism event you organise yourself.Your hard news story leads to answers, to answering the five W’s, yes, but without answering the “Sowhat?” aspect, your story will read just like an item from the police record.What makes a news item go beyond just reporting the facts to become an actual news story?You must find and focus on the angle that makes your crime, accident, or fire relevantto your readers. Otherwise, we could just read the police report to find out about thelatest accidents at our local petrol station or the fires that took place in the next town.  
Ask your news item to meet several of the following criteria to determine its newsworthiness;firstly, the impact, how many people does the issue affect? How seriously does it affect them?Secondly, proximity, an issue will be more important if it is closer to the readers or listeners.An earthquake in a far off land is not as interesting as one that is close to home.Timeliness, is the event or issue fresh? Is it new? The news must be timely to be ofuse to readers or listeners.Prominence, names make news, and big names make big news. Ordinary people are intriguedby the doings of the rich and famous, and possibly people in their communities.Novelty, this is the new in news, the unusual, the “firsts,” “lasts” and “only”have been the staples of the news business for many years.Conflict, conflict has been the currency for great literature, drama and movies forall time. From the stories of Shakespeare to those of Disney, conflict has played acrucial role. Newspapers, radios and social media sites are also no different.Your audience, who is the audience? The answer to that question helps determine whether anevent is news at all, and if it is, where it should be played on radio, on paper or whetherit will trend on social media sites.  


  
Assessing the impact of media campaigns  
Hi there, in this video we will look at assessing the impact of your media campaign and adjustingyour strategy if needs be.Assessing the impact of a media campaign is often a delicate task as it often entailslooking at details and events that have happened in wake of your campaign and figuring outif those changes have any bearing on your media campaign.  
We will look at the questions you need to ask yourself when conducting an impact assessment;we will also look at pivoting if your campaign doesn't go the way you had planned, as wellas using a results chain to assess your campaign.Whenever you conduct a media campaign, you want to make sure that some measurable orobservable outcome takes place. This can take many shapes and forms and can often be hardto spot if you do not have a plan in place to track these developments.  
Let's first look at what impact is defined as;The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines impact as a positiveor negative, primary or secondary long-term effect produced by a development intervention,directly or indirectly, intended or unintended. Impact is about long-term and lasting effects,this means that when you assess the impact of your campaign you should be able to seeor witness long term effects or benefits resulting from that campaign.This is in the context of development work but can also be used to define impact in thecontext of media campaigns. You are looking for any positive or negative effects thatare intended or unintended.When assessing your media campaign it is important to set goals from the onset which you canuse to assess whether your campaign was successful or not. Goals can be seen as the means toexpress the end points towards which effort is directed, bear in mind then that the goalsyou set must be long term if you want to measure impact.  
Goals for your campaign can fall under the following banners;  
Policy change.Awareness.Behavioural change. Social norms.Social or physical condition changes.   
Let's say you want to embark on a campaignto highlight the plight of a group of people that is affected by a socio-economic issuelike lack of access to proper sanitation. Your goals for this campaign would include:Raising awareness of this group and their plight.Affecting some sort of policy change by government, institutions or private business.And changing the conditions of this group through the goals above. Once you have setyour goals and have embarked on your media campaign, you can then begin the process ofevaluation by asking yourself some important questions.At the conclusion of your media campaign, which is after you have finished your reportingand have also published your content either on social media platforms, print media oryou have been on a local radio station to discuss the issue, you can then to sit downand assess the progress of your campaign to measure if you have or will reach the desiredlong term impact of your campaign, over a period of time.Remember that for you to see or know if you have achieved your desired impact, the plightof that group of people you are fighting for must have been heard, the government shouldhave started implementing strategies to assist and ultimately the people must get accessto proper sanitation, resulting in proper livelihoods. This is what impact is all about;longer term results brought by a particular goal or campaign.  
In this phase of reflection your goal is to answer several questions that will help youdetermine if your campaign was successful or not.What did you do? Or, in evaluation jargon, what were your outputs? What content, reportingor exposure did you make?What difference did it bring about? Or, what were your outcomes? What was the nearer-termand longer-term benefits to individuals, to policies, or systems from the media campaign you created?How well did you do it? How much time? How much money? And how much energy went intogenerating those outputs and outcomes? Could it have been done more efficiently or effectively?On face value these questions may appear to be vague and quite possibly immeasurable.But this is why it is important to set clear goals in the beginning so that you can answerthese questions against those goals at your evaluation stage.If your goal included writing six articles, producing one video and hosting a panel discussion,at the end of your campaign you can answer if you met those goals or not.If you only produced three articles and no video was created or no panel discussiontook place, then you know that you have failed or under performed as far as thegoals of your campaign are concerned. It is at this point that you can decide whetheror not you need to pivot your campaign. To pivot means to change or abandon previousefforts and make an effort towards a new goal.In the context of your media campaign you may find that your previous goal of hostinga panel discussion was unattainable due to scheduling conflicts and thus you could pivottowards getting the invited guests to send their remarks on the subject in order foryou to write up a thought-leadership piece or blog.  
Another way to track or measure the progress of your campaign is by using a results chain;based on explanations below, you could be able to track your campaign by plotting/placingactivities of your campaign in each of the stages to identify whether or not your campaignhas reached the highest level of results: impact, which is then the longer term benefitsbrought by your campaign to a particular cause or plight.  
In his online course found on edX: Results Based Management, Kieron Crawley defines theresults chain in the following way.   
INPUTS: inputs of the financial human materialand information resources used to produce outputs through engaging in activities, examplesof these may be funds, people, equipment, supplies, reports and many others. Essentiallyall of the things that we need to put in place before we can start our program activities.  
ACITIVITIES: these are the actions taken or work performed, that which are mobilised toproduce outputs. Examples of activities that we might think of could include, deliveringtraining to, construct walls, schools, negotiating partnerships with government, providing careservices to communities, allocating funds to or even distributing food aid to communities.  
OUTPUTS: these are the direct products, services infrastructure stemming from the activitiesof an organisation’s policy or program. They're usually immediately visible, concreteand tangible that is we can see them, achieved during and by the end of the project or campaign.Completed activities are not always appropriate outputs.But examples of outputs may be pamphlets distributed, research published, water treatment plantscommissioned, participants trained, food aid delivered, funding made available, mosquitonets distributed.   
OUTCOMES: occur once one or more outputs havebeen realised, they are medium term and start to emerge once a program or a project hasbecome established. We often define them in terms of change in levels of understandingand behaviour amongst the beneficiaries of our program or campaign in this case. An exampleof an outcome could be increased level of green water usage by communities.  
IMPACT OR GOAL: is the last level of the results chain. This is a high level long term developmentchange that is a logical consequence of a combination of outcomes. Often expressed interms of a region, country or province and usually seen after the project or campaignends. Examples of impact or goals that you may be aware of are the sustainable developmentgoals or national priorities.  
Some quick strategies to pivot your media campaign include the following:  
Firstly, you need to assess and change your goals: if the goals you had set at the beginningof your campaign are too lofty or not yielding the results you had hoped for then it mightbe time to change those goals to something attainable.  
Secondly, you want to refocus your goals and put your plan into motion. In other words,determine how you are actually going to execute on your campaign using new strategies youhave identified.   
And third, you want to refine your campaignand ensure that your expectations are realistic and attainable.If you want to raise awareness then it might be better to focus on raising awareness withina specific target group as opposed to the population as whole.If you want to affect policy change, a much simpler goal could be to appeal to a particularmember or members of parliament who could be the face of your campaign over time toassist you in building towards your desired impact.  
With all this said please bear in mind that campaigns need to be fluid and open tochange at any point. Thank you for watching and all the best withwhatever campaign you may be embarking on.

### Ethics in Journalism - Part 1

  
Hi I'm Susan Stos, I'm a journalist and an ethics lecturer.This module is about journalism ethics. It doesn't matter whether you are a professionalor a citizen journalist, if you want to be taken seriously you need to know about and practise ethical methods.  
But first, let's backtrack a bit: What is a journalist?We think of a journalist as someone who keeps us informed about what's happening in our world, someone who siftsthrough information to bring us the facts, someone who will tenaciously follow a storyuntil the truth is uncovered, a watchdog for democracy.  
Journalism is commonly called 'the Fourth Estate' in America, where the 3 branches ofgovernment are the legislative, executive and judicial.The press is called the Fourth Estate as opposed to the fourth branch, because it is separate and is meant to to be independentof government, to keep tabs on what the government is doing, as opposed to being part of it.Journalism is as important as that. No other group in society will investigate, monitor,and report on the workings of our democracies, the way journalists do.Something else to know about journalism is that, like medicine and law, it is a self-governing profession.That means that in a democracy, there is no one telling journalists what theycan or can't say, print or publish.In fact, if there were such rules that would mean that there would not be a free press.Freedom of speech, which includes a free press, is a democratic right.But when there are rights, there are also responsibilities.Rather than a set of rules and laws, a journalist follows codes of ethics.Those codes teach us where the lines should be drawn.It sets standards for behaviour.Codes of ethics are not laws. Laws are enforced by the government.Ethics are loftier than laws; people aspire to a higher morality when ethics, rather than laws, govern them.So what are ethics? And why are they important?Well, ethics is about trust, and our world revolves around trust.What do you suppose our societies would be like if we couldn't trust anyone or anything?We trust that the person who designed the bridge we're driving on has studied and learned how to do so competently.We trust it's been built to specification.We trust that when we turn on our tap, thedrinking water is safe to consume; that knowledgeable people are monitoring water sanitation andthose people have our best interests at heart.We trust that when the traffic light turns green, it is safe for us to proceed, thatfellow pedestrians or drivers are ethical and value human life.  
Trust must be implicit for a society to flourish. Otherwise it begins to disintegrate.And for those same reasons, we must generate news that the public deems trustworthy, so thatthey can believe what we tell them.Ethics is at the heart of everything we do as journalists.In fact, virtually every decisiona journalist makes could be considered an ethical one, it's about who we interviewand who we don't; what we ask our interviewees and what we leave out; which angles we emphasiseand those we play down. It's about how we edit a piece, how we shape it, what sources we use, how we tell our stories.In broadcast and print journalism, we can also convey messagesby the choice of visuals we use; are we appealing to emotion or are we communicating facts?While our newscast may be objective, using a photo or a clip of a leader looking foolish is loading our message.There is a code of conduct or ethical guidelines for journalists in every country.You can google your country's ethical codes to see for yourself.  
But generally, each country adheres to the following 9 principles:  
TruthfulnessAccuracyHonestyFairnessObjectivityTransparencyIndependenceAccountabilityand Humanity  
Let's start with truthfulness. As journalists we have to maintain high standards, credibilityand keep the trust of the public.It's one of our primary obligations.Telling the truth means to tell various aspects of the truth, as there may be many ways of looking at an issue.Our reports need to be balanced, therefore, and in context.Our responsibility to keep the public informed is our way of ensuring democracy.An informed public is an educated public, and a public that will be armed with facts when casting their votes.  
Accuracy is essential.And it is more crucial than ever to be accurate these days in the midst of so much unedited immediacy on social media,and of course fake news.If we are accurate, we will develop a lot of authority with our audience.The need for speed, for meeting deadlines, is no excuse for not being accurate.We all have biases. It's how we make sense of our world. But it can be very limiting, and untruthful.We are not objective if we assume that because a few people in a groupact in a certain way, then everyone else in that group is the same.We need to become aware of our own biases, and not give them 'air time' if we hope to be considered objective journalists.Have someone else check your story if you think your biases may be showing.  
Honest reporting needs to distinguish and label news from opinion and advertising.Newspapers have different sections for news and opinion. News is fact. The op-ed section is for opinionand editorials and is based on points of view from various people.Advertisements must be likewise differentiated. It is not honest to combine any of the above.If we're radio journalists, we need our listeners to be aware of when the news begins and ends, so theyrealise that it's in a different segment than opinion.In radio, it helps most to distinguish news from opinion and advertising by using different people to read each,rather than one presenter doing it all.  
We must also be careful about what sources we use.Is this person credible? Reliable?What is their background? Do they have a motive in giving us this information? Do they standto benefit in some way? Are they settling a score?Sometimes we have to use anonymous sources because they are whistle-blowers and their lives might be in danger.But seriously question anyone who wants to put information in the public arena without disclosing identity.When we report fairly, we must be true to the original intent when quoting or paraphrasing sources.That means we must never edit them so that it appears they are saying something they did not mean.For example, someone we're interviewing may say, "While I disagree withthe President, I do understand that he didn't have all the available facts when making that statement".It is ethically wrong to edit the sentence to say, "I disagree with the President",even though that is, in part, what the person has said.But that was not the context in which he or she was speaking and we must never change the meaning of a sentence.When something negative is said about a person or organisation, it is only fair that we givethem the right of response in order to defend themselves.If they choose not to, that's their business.But in telling the final story , we need to let our audience know that we did contact these people, although they had no comment.  
We shouldn't make reference to a person's gender, age, race, ethnicity, religion or liability unless the telling of the story specifically requires it.An attack on a religious institution, for example, would necessitate mentioning the religion.But most stories are not dependent on those factors.There are times when it is not possible to be objective.Stories on child abuse, for example, poaching or acts of terrorism cannot be treated objectively.But most of the time, in reporting on events, there are various opinions, viewpoints and stances. It is importantto gather these differing perspectives and contextualise them to make them comprehensible to the audience.It's part of being an objective journalist. And if we do strive to be factualand objective, our audience will have faith in what we tell them.  
We need to be transparent as journalists. That means that the methods we use in uncoveringa story should be revealed as part of our story.This is especially true in investigative journalism.Journalistic codes specify that we need to identify ourselves, and our organisation,to people we interview and hope to get information from.They need to know who they're talking to, and that what they say, could end up as public knowledge.  
Independence means that we are operating without outside influence.Journalists may find that they are offered free vacations, gifts or even money from groups or organisations.That is called 'brown bag' journalism, and is strictly forbidden.To accept such things means that our integrity is compromised, and we are no longer independent.If we need to conduct a tough interview with such an organisation, or point fingers at certain individuals whohave paid us, we may be tempted to go easy on them.If the audiences were to know that we were in someone's pocket, our validity would fly out the window.It is important to maintain a distance in order to be able to report truthfully.The same applies to paying someone for a story, also known as 'chequebook' journalism.Once we pay someone to speak to us, in essence they become an employee.They may exaggerate details, or even fabricate a story to help us out.They may also hold back on certain aspects to try to get a second payment.A paid source becomes a partial source and is more likely to give us what we want instead of sticking with the truth.In the same way, it is important not to be connected with a product or organisation.It compromises integrity and is a conflict of interest.We also don't report on issues in which we are personally involved.And we need to be independent of government, advertisers and special interest groups always.  
Journalists need to be accountable for the stories they tell.That means acknowledging and accepting responsibility for any mistakes made.If mistakes are made, it is important that the journalist and organisation correct that mistake as quickly and as clearly as possible.First, try not to make mistakes but when they do happen, own up to them and rectify them prominently.By being accountable we are also acknowledging that the work we present is our own, and not plagiarised.When information comes to us from another media source, and we have verifiedthat it is true, we don't ever claim it as our own. We can use that information, certainly,but we must attribute our sources.To pass off someone else's work as our own is one of the worst sins a journalist can commit.Accountability also includes verifying and checking out the background of our sources.Just because someone has told us something does not make it true. People often have agendas.  
Humanity means we must 'do no harm'. We need to respect the privacy, reputation and livesof the people we're reporting on.For that reason, it is crucial to understand the difference between news that is in thepublic interest, and news that the public is interested in.The public interest is about the welfare of the public; about events or happenings thatthe public has a right to, and should know about.It's keeping the public informed so they are in possession of the latest and correct information.News that the public is interested in may be the same, but, for example, the publicmight be very interested in Meaghan Markler and Prince Harry's marriage.That is not news we need to know to have a functioning democracy.That kind of news is more about curiosity of other people's lives.Feeding that kind of interest is what gives rise to the paparazzi.Because someone is a public figure does not mean that they should be hounded in their private lives.It leads to invasion of privacy, which is the antithesis of 'do no harm'.What with the proliferation of fake news, we need to ensure that what we're saying is the truth.It's so easy to spread panic, or to cause someone's reputation a lot of damage.Discrimination and hate speech must not play a part in our news gathering.There should be specific consideration of children and reporting on children.Generally, they should not be identified or interviewed without specific permission from their parents.And while we may find someone who is very eager to tell all, it is our responsibilityto discern whether they are aware of the implications of what they're saying.Those who are used to being in the media and giving public statements would understand how the media works.Other people may not.In broadcast or photojournalism, we must be mindful of the impact our words and visualswill have on our audience, such as being sensitive about the kinds of visuals we reveal.Close-ups of car accidents in which people have died, for example, could be very damaging to therelatives of the deceased, or to sensitive viewers.It's enough to show wide shots and maybe closer visuals of the damaged vehicles without seeing dead bodies, blood and gore.  
If we were to distinguish between an activist and a journalist, I think Al Jazeera sumsit up best: 'An activist tries to influence the debate whereas a journalist helps create an informed debate.'They go on to say that 'Objectivity and impartiality are the pillars of journalism.The voice of the activist should be one of the many voices to be heard in the report or article'.In other words, tell the various sides of the story if we want to be considered a journalist, and not just an activist.Remember that as journalists, whether citizen or professional, we only have integrity until we lose it.We have to assure our audiences that what we say is worth listening to.If we have shown that we make too many mistakes, or that we have many biases, our credibilityis affected. And once it's gone, it's very difficult to get it back.  
One aspect of being an ethical journalist that is not often mentioned, but is quite key, is bravery.Bravery to uncover a story no one else will touch, bravery to resist temptation, bravery to change the status quo.  
Now what about online journalism? Is it bound by the same ethical codes as traditional journalism?Many news organisations do not distinguishbetween online news gathering and conventional news gathering, saying the same codes of ethics are applicable.However, there is an organisation - the Online News Association or ONA that outlinesthe standards and practices of user-generated content. \(Frank note: [https://ethics.journalists.org/topics/user-generated-content/](https://ethics.journalists.org/topics/user-generated-content/)\)The ONA is the largest association of digital journalists in the world, founded by organisationssuch as the BBC and CNN to name a few and adopted by many more globally.It might be a good source when considering how you'd like to handle using content by generated the public.Transparency, accuracy, authenticity of sources,seeking informed consent and crediting sources are particularly important in both onlinenews gathering and using content by the public.Remember that we can dig up just about any opinion on the internet, but the source of the information is what's all important.Find out which sources are trustworthy, who is behind them, whether they have an agenda, or if they are sponsored.Those factors tend to skew the veracity of the information they publish.Of course anyone engaging in social mediacan convey information, and there is a place for that.Citizen journalism can be immediate, and warn of impending dangers whereas professional journalists tend to tell about it after the fact.But we can see that if citizen journalists are untrained, the public can become vulnerable to fake news and fear mongering.There are many modern academics thinking thatwith the open media, ethics are not just about journalism, but about all of us.  
And that citizen journalism is a very important aspect of guarding democracy.They may bear witness to history unfolding when the mainstream media is not around to record it.There may be an authenticity about citizen journalism that others cannot capture.With this kind of journalism, however, there is no editor.Nobody to rein back an eager investigation with warnings of reputational damage. No oversight.So citizen journalists need to bear the same ethics in mind, such as objectivity, truth and accuracy etc.Arguably, it is only ethics, and following journalistic principles thattruly distinguishes a citizen journalist from a professional.So we've learned all the major points about journalism ethics, for professionals, citizen and online alike.  
But is it that easy? What do we do if some of the ethics contradict each other?Maybe, in following some of the principles, we may compromise others.For example, how do we remain honest and accurate journalists when stories that are in the publicinterest are so difficult to uncover?We'll talk about that a bit later.  
  


  
Ethics in Journalism - Part 2  
One thing that is important to know about ethics is that we all would like to thinkwe'll do the right thing at the right time. But that's not the case. Our ethical reasoningis sometimes just a gut reaction, or a sense that something feels right or wrong.But unless we prepare for it, we don't know how we'll react. Ethics takes practice, just like anything else.We need to develop our moral reasoning. Did you know that our ethics are affectedby such things as:whether we're hungry, if we're pressed for time,whether we're attracted to or repulsed by someone,our evolutionary moral code, some of which is good, other bits are long defunctwhether we see other people behaving unethically, and whether those people behaving unethicallyare in our group, when we have motive, opportunity, collusionwhether we're feeling lustful, or whether we're being obedient,where we're asked for help, whether we're liberal or conservative in our outlook,or whether we've found a coin even.  
It's true. And there are many other instances when our ethics can fail us.In fact, studies indicate that our ethics are very undependable.That has led me to believe that if we want to be able to rely on our ethics, we need reason when making ethical decisions.There are a number of methods to help us decide how to deal with a moral dilemma, but I particularlylike one I devised called APPLY Ethics.Part of APPLY Ethics is knowing ourselves well.It's about recognising our best intentions and motives; it's about considering what kind of person we want to be.It's a 5 step process that goes like this:  
A - Assess the situation and possible actions, P - Principles of ethical journalism,P - Philosophy of life, how we operate in the world,L - Loyalties involved in the decision making process,Y - Yes/No questions to confirm our decision.  
Let's look at a case study: We are investigating a story that could be explosive.We suspect that someone in the education department is selling final mathematicsexams to schools that are willing to pay.We have heard rumours from various sources,and we're almost certain of the facts, but have yet to get enough information to feel that we can reliably run our story.We do think that some high school students willbe receiving better marks than they should, and some schools will rate higher than they deserve.We have tried repeatedly to get an interviewwith the suspect or someone in her office but as soon as they hear we are from the media, we get no further.The end of the school year is approaching.We know that if we use deception, it will be no problem to break the story.All we'd have to do is to call up the education department and ask to speak to the administrator we suspectof selling the exams. We could say that we are a head of a school, we understand that our studentscould possibly do very well on the upcoming final Maths exams.We engage in a conversation that sets her up while we record the whole thing without her knowledge.Once we get her speaking, we would know if rumours are true and would have confirmation of her involvement.But there are two problems with that;1, Journalism ethics dictate that we identify ourselves when news-gatheringand 2, It is unethical and in some places, illegal to tapea conversation without the subject being told. So what should we do?  
Well let's first assess the situation:We suspected the administrator in the education department of corruption,we don't have undisputable details on the matter, not enough to run the story,the end of the school year, and exams, are approaching.we have tried to get information using the conventionally, ethical methods.Our choices are to use deception and possiblyget the story, or continue to flog away at it using ethical methods and possibly never proving it.  
Let's look at the principles of ethical journalism again:Truthfulness,Accuracy,Honesty,Fairness,Objectivity,Transparency,Independence,Accountability,and Humanity.We can see right away that in this situation, our principles of ethical journalism are at odds with each other.Honesty, fairness and transparency, particularly, are at odds with our circumstances.  
Let's now look at philosophy,many people have never given this much thought before.Do you believe in a religious philosophy, such as doing to others what you'd like done to you?（Frank note: 己所不欲，勿施于人。）Every major religion has a basis in this philosophy.Or maybe you believe that we're all part of a whole, and what affects one of us affects all of us?Maybe you live your life paying it forward? You believe in random acts of kindness?Think about your own personal philosophy, how you operate in the world.If we spend some time thinking about who we are and what we value, ethical thinking becomes part of it.Our principles are like a vehicle, but our philosophy is like a GPS.Together they get us to the person and journalist we want to be.  
Now conflicting loyalties is where we most often get stuck with making ethical decisions.So list down all the loyalties that would apply here.Some that occur to me are:Loyalty to the truth, Loyalty to honestyLoyalty to the public interest.As we discussed earlier, it means more than what the public is interested in.If this situation continued, would it affect the functioning of society?That's how you tell:Loyalty to our organisation, Loyalty to ourself- we must always be loyalto ourself; to the person/journalist we want to be.These are some of the loyalties that would occur to us making our decision - maybe you'd have more.And it might seem that we're no further ahead now, and our minds are still conflicted.So this is where we weigh one loyalty against the other.One decision at a time. It takes the emotion out; it makes the choice much easier.  
So each time we choose one loyalty over the other, we need to make a note of it.In this situation, would you be more loyalto the truth, or honesty? To truth or the public interest? To truth or your organisation?To truth or yourself? Put a tick beside the loyalty you chose.In this situation would you rather be loyal to honesty or the public interest?To honesty or your organisation? To honesty or to yourself?Would you be more loyal to the public interest or your organisation?The public interest or yourself?And finally, which loyalty would you choose between your organisation and yourself?We start at the top of the loyalty list and compare down each time.  
Then start at the second point, again comparing down, until each loyalty has been compared to every other one.Add up each time a loyalty was chosen. Our primary loyalties are now obvious, and that will help in making a decision.But just to confirm that we are on the correctpath, we need to ask ourselves these 3 questions:1- Is it legal? 2- How would I feel if my actions were posted publicly? 3- How would I feel if my parents and/or children knew?Sometimes when groups of people are intensely involved in a common task, there is a phenomenonknown as ethical fading, and ethical blindness.It's important to take oneself momentarily out of that framework to do this quick reality check.So, our decision is reasoned after weighing the factors and possible choices, by rememberingthe principles of journalism, our guiding philosophy, our top loyalties in this situation, and considering the 3 questions.We know that the decision we have made hasbeen thought through carefully. It is a decision we can live with.  
The journalistic principles and our philosophy will become second nature, but it's alwaysgood to review them and remind ourselves.Loyalties will change in various situations.The more this process is used, the easier it becomes.It's also beneficial to use APPLY ethics as a group.Debate can only make for a better thought-through conclusion.In this situation, considering the journalistic principles and loyalties, it is likely thattruth and the public interest would be near the top.So what does that mean for honesty and transparency?If this should happen, not ideal, certainly,but perhaps it's the only way to get information, then we must be honest and transparent aboutHOW we went about it. We need to tell our audience that we usually identify ourselvesas journalists up front, but in this instance we did not, so we could uncover this storythat we felt was overwhelmingly in the public interest.Nor do we usually illicitly tapetelephone conversations, but again, we needed proof before we could bring the situation into the public arena.  
How we get the story is possibly as important as the story itself and the audience should be enlightened about our process.When using deceit as a method of getting a story, thatmust be incorporated into the telling of the story. And the story must be in the publicinterest to justify deceit.Becoming an ethical journalist, or person, takes some effort. It's not something we can do on the fly.Moral reasoning is a skill that develops, and becomes easier, with practice.This is how we become journalists, and people, with integrity, credibility and self-respect.

## Course on edX

This course introduces the strategic framework that underlies any social program--whether concerned with health, education, drug abuse, or the environment-- offered by a nonprofit organization or government agency.[1](https://courses.edx.org/xblock/block-v1:StanfordOnline+SOL.XPHILANSTRATEGY+1T2020+type@vertical+block@d88c994897d0442aa5944880ee60c781?show\_title=0\&show\_bookmark\_button=0\&recheck\_access=1\&view=student\_view#ref1)A strategy is essentially a plan for how you will get to your intended destination. I doubt that you would willingly board a plane whose pilots were too busy to file a flight plan. Yet many nonprofit executives and government officials seem unwilling to plan for the longer and more complex journey involved in their organizations' efforts to achieve social change.This may be because creating a reasonably detailed strategy seems like a daunting task. It is tempting just to throw money at the problem and assume that it is doing good. But strategic planning is not as difficult as one might think. More important, it's the only way that the organization can succeed in achieving its goals.![](file:///C:/Users/frank/AppData/Local/Temp/enhtmlclip/Image\(5\).jpg)![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MQkus9eSG1e8or-Ta-Q%2Fuploads%2FsZw6MusaDZRkzi8qUSMn%2Ffile.jpeg?alt=media)There's a famous military adage that no strategy survives the first encounter with the enemy. Indeed, Dwight D. Eisenhower said: "in preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless." But General Eisenhower went on to say that "planning is indispensable." Why? Because no leader would take his troops into battle without a plan—a plan based on the best of his knowledge at the outset, but one that he is ready to change -- to adapt in the light of new information as soon as it is available.Solving social and environmental problems is at least as difficult as winning a military battle. You need to start with your own "battle plan" to tackle these problems and be ready to adapt it as you encounter unexpected challenges.This course will take you through the essentials of nonprofit and philanthropy strategy. You will apply the basic elements of strategic planning―from defining the problem through designing a theory of change to evaluating outcomes―to real-world problems. With this foundation, you will be able to develop strategies that will inform your work as a nonprofit leader, philanthropist, or policy maker, and help ensure that you achieve demonstrable long-term impact, rather than the illusion of results.My goal in this course is to help you develop a flight plan for your organization—a plan based on an accurate map of the environment in which you will operate-- and then to learn how to get feedback to make necessary course corrections along the way. For, in truth, achieving social change is less like a trip in a jetliner, and often more like a small plane in uncertain weather, subject to unanticipated air currents.Here is a detailed outline of the issues we shall cover:

### Identify the problem and intended outcome

* What's the problem you are trying to solve, for whom is it a problem, and why is it important?
* Who are your intended beneficiaries?
* Who else is tackling the problem and how might you collaborate?
* What are causes of the problem?
* How big a part of the problem do you want to tackle and what approach will you take—in terms of scope, timeframe, and strategic tools?
* What's your intended outcome?
* Tentatively choose a promising approach (strategic pathway) to solving the problem.

### Develop a strategy to achieve the outcome

* What's the theory of change leading to the outcome?
* What stakeholders may be affected by your solution?
* What are major weaknesses in your theory of change, and barriers to achieving your goals? How will you overcome them?
* What are the beneficiaries' needs?
* Identify behavior changes needed for your plan to succeed. How will you achieve them?
* How would your proposed solution affect and be affected by the broader system in which the problem and solution exist?

### Implement the strategy

* Draft an implementation plan for the strategy.
* Specify metrics and targets for assessing progress as you implement the strategy.
* Specify outcome metrics and targets, based on which the organization's effectiveness and your own performance will be evaluated.
* Adjust strategy/implementation based on feedback.

### Evaluate the strategy

Design a plan for evaluating the impact of your strategy.

### Scale the program

Identify problems in replicating or scaling the program.

## The Vast Universe of Philanthropic Interests

Think about your and your friends' philanthropic interests--whether manifest through the donations of money or time--and you will probably come up with a large and diverse collection. Philanthropists and the organizations they support are concerned with helping the poor, curing diseases, promoting the arts, mitigating climate change, protecting wildlife … you name it. And they are concerned with achieving these objectives locally, globally, and in between.There are philosophical and religious theories that argue that some of these objectives are more valuable than others. For example, in an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/magazine/the-singer-solution-to-world-poverty.html) that inspired the contemporary[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective\_altruism)[effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective\_altruism) movement, the philosopher Peter Singer put forward a utilitarian theory that calls for relentless redistribution until the value of the "life you can save" is less than the personal sacrifice entailed in saving that life. In applying this principle to philanthropy Singer [asks](http://bostonreview.net/forum/peter-singer-logic-effective-altruism), "Does promoting the arts count as improving the world?" and responds that "it might in a world that has overcome extreme poverty, but not in ours: where there are lives to be saved, other goods are not worth pursuing." Moreover, since all lives are equally valuable, effective altruism has no reason to prefer helping people in your community just because you identify with them. rather than others across the globe--especially if those others are more in need.Although my own view is that philanthropists, myself included, should do more than we do to address global poverty and problems that threaten humankind, this course is designed to aid you in pursuing whatever interests motivate you.Effective altruism also has a second strain, however--the belief that philanthropists should try to be effective in achieving whatever goals they pursue. Mastering the elements of strategy is like mastering calculus or statistics--learning a framework and skills that can be used for a wide variety of purposes. And that's the goal of this course.

## Fundamental Readings

In addition to Professor Glaeser's book, [Triumph of the City](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+Urban101x+3T2020/183d28fa31c846b8ac31d89debdb415b/), here are a few other books that we think are key for understanding the development of cities, and where they will go in the future. Reading these books is not required for passing this course, but we recommend you explore the ones that interest you — many were written for a general audience, and provide a superb grounding in urban studies:

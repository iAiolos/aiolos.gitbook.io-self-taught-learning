## Introduction

#### Course Goals

This course has two goals. The first goal is to introduce you to key questions in ethics:

* What makes your life go better or worse for you?
* Can ethics be objective?
* What are the main historical approaches in ethics?
* What do you owe to others?

The second goal is to get you thinking rigorously about ethical questions yourself. This will help you develop your critical reasoning and argumentative skills more generally.

#### Lectures

There are 16 lectures in the course. Each lecture is divided into several units. Each lecture consists of:

* A reading assignment. We link to the reading at the start of each lecture. (You can also find the readings in the Course Handouts, on the right-hand side of the Course Outline page.) The readings are a key part of the course. You'll get much more out of the lectures if you do the readings first. We've aimed to keep them short, but some are difficult, so you'll want to take your time over them.
* Video clips. These are the heart of the course, designed to introduce the material. You should watch all the videos. You can adjust the playback speed and every video has a transcript.
* Computer-graded exercises. These are short questions, designed to check or improve your understanding of the material. You should attempt every question. They're all due by August 19 at 1600 UTC, which is the end of the course, so you can take them at your own pace. They count towards your final grade. You only get 1 attempt for each question. So take your time and think before you click.
* Discussion questions. These are open-ended questions, designed to let you develop your own ideas about the material and to interact with other learners in the course. You should discuss these questions on the Discussion Forum. Discussing the material with other learners is the best way to improve your understanding of it, so we strongly encourage you to participate in the Discussion Forum.

#### Written Assessments

There are 4 written assessments in the course. In each written assessment, you should pick one of the questions we set and write a short essay in response. If you are enrolled as a Verified Learner, you will receive written comments on your essay from a philosophy instructor. If you are enrolled as an Audit Learner, we ask you to self-assess your essay, using a rubric which we provide.It's not easy to write a good philosophy essay. If you're new to it, we recommend Jim Pryor's [Guidelines on Writing a Philosophy Paper](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/writing.html).Note that no extensions will be granted for the written assessments. In a course with so many learners, granting individual extensions just isn't feasible. Please make sure to plan accordingly.

#### Grading

Your final grade is determined by the exercises in the lectures and the written assessments. Each lecture's exercises are worth 2% of your final grade. So the exercises count for a total of 16 \* 2% = 32% of your final grade. Each written assessment is worth 17% of your final grade. So the written assessments count for a total of 4 \* 17% = 68% of your final grade. To pass the course, you need a final grade of at least 70%.

PlagiarismYour essays and contributions to the Discussion Forum must be your own work. If you are quoting someone, put it in quotation marks and cite your source. If you are paraphrasing someone or using their ideas, cite your source. If you are found to have plagiarized, you will be given a failing grade in the course.\

#### Discussion Forum

The best way to learn philosophy is by doing philosophy, especially doing philosophy with others. That's the purpose of the Discussion Forum. We strongly encourage you to participate. Contribute early, contribute often! You will get so much more out of the course if you do.In each lecture we set several discussion questions: you should discuss other learners' responses and add your own. When contributing to these discussions, please add a response to our post instead of creating a new post. That helps keep everyone's responses in the same place, making it easier for us and you to see what people are saying.You can also create your own posts on the Discussion Forum. For example, at the end of each lecture you will have a chance to discuss any further questions or comments about that lecture's material.You can access the Discussion Forum in two ways: through the discussion component at the bottom of most units, or by clicking the Discussion tab in the toolbar along the top of your screen.Anything you post on the forum will be visible to the 24.02x course team, as well as your fellow learners. The forum moderator—Cosmo Grant, for the first half of the course, and David Balcarras, for the second half—will monitor the forums regularly. We are here to help you learn. We love doing philosophy and we are very much looking forward to doing philosophy with all of you.

#### Tips for Using the Forum Effectively

* Be specific. Choose a descriptive title, and provide as much information as possible: Which part of which problem or video? Why do you not understand the question? What have you tried doing?
* Search before asking. The forum becomes hard to use if there are too many threads and good discussions happen when people participate in the same thread. So before asking a question, use the search feature to see if someone's already asked it. If they have, add a response to their post to follow up on the question.
* Upvote good posts. This makes them easier for others to find.
* Talk to each other. Read and respond to what other people have said. Philosophy is a conversation, not a monologue.
* Notify staff. If your question is specifically for the course team, write "\[Staff]" at the start of your title.
* Technical problems. If you're having technical trouble with the site, please post in the "Technical Problems" category on the forum.

#### Etiquette

* Be nice. Let's develop a welcoming, encouraging community. Remember that learners come from all over the world and from all sorts of backgrounds.
* Avoid all caps. This can come across as AGGRESSIVE, even if you don't mean it that way.
* Avoid text-speak. Pls don’t r3plce wrds w/ #s.
* Avoid repeating letters, liiiiiiiiiike thiiiiiisssssssssss.
* Avoid excessive punctuation. What do we mean?????? This kind of thing!!!!!!!

#### Written Assessments Grading Rubric

If you are enrolled as a Verified Learner, you will receive feedback on your essays from a philosophy instructor. If you are enrolled as an Audit Learner, we ask you to self-assess your essay, using the following rubric. You should refer back to this rubric when you are writing your essays.Writing Clarity: Is the writing clear?

| Fair    | The author has made some effort to think through the material in his or her terms, but does not push the issue much beyond how it was presented in the lecture and readings. | 3       |
| Good    | The author has made a substantial effort to think through the material in his or her terms and/or pushes it beyond how it was presented in the lecture and readings.         | 5       |

# Rehabilitation and Fitness and Health

Time went by. I have switched my notebook tool from the Evernote to the Notion. Many things have happened, even though they haven't been recorded.

My left leg is a significant thing in my life these days. After that Lunar New Year, I came back to Hangzhou, tough time walking inside the airports because of the inflammation of my knee. I saw the doctor said to be the best for joint problems, and he had me take MRI, and told me that my knee is structurally fine, and suggested Physical Rehabilitation.

The two brands of rehabilitation recommended by the doctor are too far for me to reach. I found a hospital that is not a lot far away, where is the so-called sports injury medicine department. After simply checking, they give me physiotherapy, which is really basic including Electrical Stimulation and Ultrasound, and calf shifting without weight load. The physiotherapist told me to stretch my leg straight when I was standing and walking.

If I could do that, why had I asked for their help?

I must learn how to rehabilitate myself.

It's too slow, though.

My leg can't wait, I guess.

In addition, book knowledge only lets me understand theories about sports injuries and reconditioning, and understanding is fucking bullshit. Things like rehabilitation are definitely about practice rather than understanding.

Furthermore, while a person is doing physical exercise, he or she must be instructed and reminded and protected to do or from something by another guy that is professional.

I finally found a service for rehabilitation that is not that far from me and therefore available.

It's like improve muscle strength, and learn to stand and walk from the first place. It's unpleasant, of course. But at the same time, insofar as new experience is concerned, it's sort of interesting.

In the aspect of knowledge, Rehabilitation is about human movement science and involves sophisticated practice. It's likely over the gap between sports medicine and gym exercise, but the gap is super huge. It's critical for our society that some professionals occupy the huge gap providing professional service, especially considering that many people — even if not almost everybody — have sort of problems of skeleton and muscle and nerve system imbalance, not necessarily waiting until the injuries.

# At forty, I had no doubts

We have an old saying in China, “At thirty, I stood firm. At forty, I had no doubts." I'm not a big fan of Confucius. When I was thirty, of course I stood firmly. Before my left leg hurt, my legs not only allowed me to stand firmly, but they also enable me move with speed, agility, and quickness. I'm kidding. Confucius's old proverb is a metaphor. However, the problem is there have been billions of interpretation of what it means. So the matter is not about the original meaning of that old saying, but about how to act in one's own way.

After forty, there is no doubt that I will be increasingly confused. I have been aware the world is complicated, that the cities are complicated, that the human body is complicated. The complication always arouses my curiosity.

Here is a brief summary of what I have learned this year.

Operation of charity organization. There are numerous mysteries surrounding the charity industry, as well as the concept of "charity". "Charity" is not the same as "love". "Love" is a polluted and spoiled word, so do the Chinese word "爱". "Charity" is a word close to "慈悲", which means you have to have your clear strategy and tactic, which means you have to have an executive force that would be far more powerful than that in business activities, which means you have to ignore part of the desperate people in order to help another part of the suffering. Because the resources are limited all the time.

Moral philosophy. Whenever you want to do something creative, you are almost always confronted with a moral dilemma or two. Then you'll find there is not a ready-made ethic code that works in your specific situation. You have to build your own ethic system from the ground up, just as you would a mathematics system, reasoning with solid logic. Any old saying is not of help. Moral philosophy is a fundamental discipline.

The global urbanization process. There are lots of things strange in Chinese city life. You perceive the newest and the oldest factors to be present at the same time in every level of daily life. One of the reasons is that China has been rapidly developing and urbanizing for the past forty years. The planet is too big, and China is too big, and their evolution is too long to be grasped intuitively by a single person with such a short lifespan. However, a city is not that big, and the dominant factors of urbanization are not that many. One person is not living in a planet or a country, but a city.

Accounting. Many businesses have so called Finance personnel, but it's difficult to find a good one who truly understands accounting, especially when it comes to corporate strategy and cost control. There are tons of books on business theory available, but business operations are merely the result of accounting design. If you only learned business theory and didn't understand accounting, you would only have a superficial understanding of the subject, never getting to the heart of the matter.

Python, as one of the programming languages. Many years ago, I was certain that I would never be a professional programmer. I'm not new to programming, but Python is a new language to me. This year when I reviewed some basic computer knowledge through the using of Python, I understood some basic principles that I had once crammed. When I wrote some codes for some very simple math questions, for the first time I found coding was a big fun.

Excel and database technology. As a tool, the digital sheet is totally different from other document software like Words and PowerPoint and stuff. It's not just about how to arrange information in a table. Instead, it's about using a simple tool to implement a database. Excel is the simplest database tool. There are many database demands in life and at work. Typically, in accountancy, you must utilize database principles to design your data structures. Despite the fact that there are lots of accounting software, the data structures they provide are not really suitable for your specific scenarios.

Walking. I had come a long way in the wrong walking model after my leg hurt, or perhaps before. So I have to relearn how to stand up from a chair, stand firmly on the ground, walk naturally, jog steadily, and jump safely. For average people to be healthy, Workout and physical exercise is about muscle balance and proper movement of the entire body rather than muscle mass or losing weight. Walking is a highly integrated human body movement that is not as simple as you might imagine. Everyone must walk, but many people walk with an improper gait. Walking in the correct manner is essential and critical to one's health.

At forty, we have respective confusion, which would lead us go further in respective direction.&#x20;

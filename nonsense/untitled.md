# Gamblers In A Song

The other day a friend recommended a song called "Easy" to me, which belongs to country music. I listened to it, and it sounded good, so I was trying to find myself more country music to listen to, then I found a song that is called "The Gamblers" and I love it.

I had ever listened to a lot of country music when I started liking the singer and writer, Leonard Cohen. By the way, I consider country music is a kind of folk music, but folk music is not necessarily country music. So perhaps Leonard Cohen's songs are not classified as country music, I'm not sure.

"The gamblers", which was written by Don Schlitz and sung most famously by Kenny Rogers, is very different from Cohen's songs. It's simpler: simpler music structure; simpler story structure; simpler rhythm; simpler melody; simpler words.

Sometimes something simple can arouse emotional interest and sort of unsophisticatedly philosophical feeling since they demonstrate stories and rhythms straight.

Here is its lyric, and I have divided it into several sections according to its music structure:



_On a warm summers evening_

_On a train bound for nowhere_

_I met up with a gambler_

_We were both too tired to sleep_

_So we took turns a staring_

_Out the window at the darkness_

_Til boredom overtook us_

_And he began to speak_

\_\_

_He said, son, I've made a life_

_Out of reading people's faces_

_And Knowing what the cards were_

_By the way they held their eyes_

_So if you don't mind my saying_

_I can see you're out of aces_

_For a taste of your whiskey_

_I'll give you some advice_

\_\_

_So I handed him my bottle_

_And he drank down my last swallow_

_Then he bummed a cigarette_

_And asked me for a light_

_And the night got deathly quiet_

_And his face lost all expression_

_Said, if you're gonna play the game, boy_

_You gotta learn to play it right_

_You got to know when to hold 'em_

_Know when to fold 'em_

_Know when to walk away_

_And know when to run_

_You never count your money_

_When you're sitting at the table_

_There'll be time enough for counting_

_When the dealing's done_

\_\_

_Every gambler knows_

_That the secret to surviving_

_Is knowing what to throw away_

_Knowing what to keep_

_'Cause every hand's a winner_

_And every hand's a loser_

_And the best that you can hope for_

_Is to die in your sleep_

\_\_

_And when he'd finished speaking_

_He turned back toward the window_

_Crushed out his cigarette_

_And faded off to sleep_

_And somewhere in the darkness_

_The gambler, he broke even_

_But in his final words_

_I found an ace that I could keep_

_..._



The story is that a young man, which is referred to as "I" in the lyric, meets an old man who is a gambler on a train bound for nowhere, or the two men don't care which direction the train goes in.

They are getting bored in the dark night.

The gambler asks the young man for whiskey and cigarette and fire. In exchange, the gambler tells the young man some advice for life.

The old man's saying involves some professional terms of card games or poker games. I just have some experience of "Texas Hold'em", and it helps me understand what the gambler is talking about. Here are two examples:

The term "you're out of aces". "Aces" are the biggest cards, the "A". You have no ace, implying that you are unlucky, or even in trouble.

The terms "hold", and "fold". If your cards are good enough, according to some probability numbers by your heart, you will "hold" them and go on playing, otherwise, you "fold" them and leave the particular round.

All the saying from the old man is a metaphor. He talks about life in the terms of poker games.

"You never count your money when you're sitting at the table.

There'll be time enough for counting when the dealing's done."

It means that you should never worry about your gain and loss in life, especially when you are in front of other people, and especially when you are playing the game. Instead, you should wait until, perhaps, life is at its end, and then worry about how much you made or didn't make, how much success you had or didn't have.

At the end of the story, the old man died; "the gambler, he broke even". "To break even" means that to neither make money nor lose money in business activities. Here it means the old man, neither gained anything, nor lost anything in his whole life.

He died in his sleep, just like he had said, "the best that you can hope for

is to die in your sleep", after his last swallow of whiskey and his last lighting and crushing out of a cigarette.

I think the story is beautiful.

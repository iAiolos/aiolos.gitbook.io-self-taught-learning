# Two Mistakes In Studying English

In the road of studying English before, we made a great many mistakes among which there were two wrong mechanisms that were primary and fundamental.

The mechanisms didn't just appear in the past time, however, they are running extensively nowadays.

The first one is "studying English". If you were a kid under 7 or 8, you might need to study a given language especially in the way that you get pure language without any other subjects. But you are not. We have already become adults for so many years, and we have already learned this simple pure language knowledge about both Chinese and English for so many years. We don't need to study English, and all we need is to study (=find out solutions for given problems) and enjoy various matters through English, or other languages.

The second one is "passive studying". "passive studying" is literally an irony (â‰ˆ a joke) and is literally absurd, because "studying" must be active and be with passion.

This mistake is even more important than the first one, and this one has made and is making and will make the majority of people run into the the  wrong fucking way in which they won't learn a non-native language forever.

It's definitely wrong for us to wish that we could memorize (=store, input) every expression in a language and then we could remember (=recall, retrive, output) them as we want to read and litsen and express something. Although, it's absolutely a fact how we studied English before. Our brains, human brain, don't work like a machine or computer. Computers are able to store a great many information materials into their RAM and hard driver, and retrieve any materials anywhere anywhen. Human brain doesn't run like that, because the brain is more complex and more sophisticated. Just like shouldn't using computers as heavy hammers, we have to entirely avoid using our brains as stupid computers and damn silly artificial intelligence (AI).

The right mechanism for the human brain is to express something with sentences freely, casually and spontaneously. This is the essentially important and even the only important thing. Pay attention to the words "freely, casually and spontaneously" -- and let's explain it with Mandarin   (=standard Chinese language) -- "xia ji ba biao da, biao da de yi si shi shuo huo zhe xie".

When we read and listen, it's passive, or at least probably passive. It might seem familiar to us when we look at or listen to some sentence patterns, phrases and words. When we want to speak and write something, however, we aren't able to find them out from our brains quickly and precisely.

Only in writing and reading, it's active to all the language elements, and they are necessarily active.

Strictly, there are two steps for the right mechanism:

1\. Express something about the ourselves' actual world freely, casually and spontaneously (= xia ji ba biao da);

2\. Correct the various mistakes in the expression instantly.

In step2, we need somewhat of inside ability of self-correcting, and need an outside tool. For self-correcting, it's like we will know what's wrong as adult even if we speak wrong or write wrong. For outside tools, based on my test, there is only one, the Google, and all other internet search engines aren't able to meet the requirement. When we need some outside tools to help us to correct our language mistakes, we just need one function of search engine which is called "exactly search". We need it to return results with matching every characters exactly, no semantic guessing, no fuzzy matching, no all of the intelligent abilities. This is a very simple and basic function for search engines, but nowadays all search engines provide stupidly intelligent abilities and refuse to provide the simplest function, except Google.

I have described the two primary problems and solutions for them. First, don't study English, study and enjoy various subjects through English. Second, express something with sentences freely, casually and spontaneously and then get self-correcting instantly.
